* **W3SCHOOLS:** we strongly recommend newbies on HTML to use [HTML] (https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

## Installation
There are several text editors one can use. The likes of Code Blocks, Sublime Text, Notepadd ++, Visual studio code etc. But we prefer and strongly recommend
Visual studio code because it features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, 
VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more
